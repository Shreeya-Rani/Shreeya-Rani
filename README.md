I am a 15 year old confident high schooler from the state of Bihar, India. I love working with HTML and CSS to create beautiful Web Designs, I have also worked with Javascript, Python and Java before. Apart from that I am a Graphic Designer, Watercolor Artist, "let's mess around" artist :P, Hobbyist writer, and a book worm. In the free time I usually paint or have fun while messing aroung on Canva or Figma. My hobbies include of Cooking, Baking and listening to music as well. I am club leader of Hackclub CodeTheTech and a budding entrepreneur. Right now I have my complete focus on my academics, passion and life. 
I live with my mom, love all my friends (the 4 friends I have got), and enjoy spending time with my family (though I spend majority of my time on PC).
